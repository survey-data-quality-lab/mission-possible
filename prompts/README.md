# Prompts

- In this directory you will find the **simple** and **complex** prompts we used to run our various browser agents.
- GitHub renders `.md` files as formatted text. If you want to see the **actual Markdown / prompt code** (with list markers, backticks, etc.), click **“Raw”** in the top right of the file.
