# Prompts

- In this directory you will find the **simple** and **complex** prompts we used to run our AI agents in the paper.
- You will also find a **sample video** of the Perplexity Comet web-browser agent taking the survey (to be added).
  
> **Note:** GitHub renders `.md` files as formatted text. To see the actual Markdown / prompt code (with list markers, backticks, etc.), open the file and click **“Raw”** in the top right.
