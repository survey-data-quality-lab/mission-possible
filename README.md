# Mission Possible: Data Quality in Online Surveys

Welcome 👋  
This repository accompanies the paper **“Mission Possible: Data Quality in Online Surveys”** and collects all materials needed to replicate or adapt our setup.

## What’s inside

- **Paper**  
  The working paper (PDF). See [`paper/`](paper/).  
  > If GitHub can’t preview the PDF, click **Download** to view it locally.

- **Data and analysis code**  
  Scripts we used to clean and analyze the data, and example datasets when we can share them. See [`paper/data/`](paper/data/) (will be populated it asap).

- **Qualtrics / tracking scripts**  
  JavaScript snippets used in the survey to track behavior, keystrokes, or page activity. See [`trackers/`](trackers/) and the individual subfolders.

- **Video attention question**  
  Code to generate your own version of the video-based attention check, plus example outputs. See [`attention-video/`](attention-video/).
  
- **Prompts**  
  The **simple** and **complex** agent prompts used in the paper. See [`prompts/`](prompts/).


## Using this repository

1. Browse to the folder you need (e.g. `attention-video/`).
2. Open that folder’s own `README.md` for installation and usage.
3. Adapt the parameters to your own survey platform (Qualtrics, oTree, nodeGame).
