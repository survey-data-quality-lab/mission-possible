# Working Paper

- Here you can find the working paper (PDF).
- The **data** and **data analysis code** used in the paper are available in the top-level [`paper/data/`](../paper/data/) directory of this repository. The analysis scripts are under [`paper/data/analysis/`](../paper/data/analysis/).
- GitHub sometimes cannot preview large/complex PDFs. If the PDF does not render in the browser, click **Download** (the “Download raw file” button) to view it locally.
