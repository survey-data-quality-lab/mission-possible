# Video-based attention question

This directory contains the code we used to **generate the video attention question** described in the appendix.

There are currently two variants:

- [`generator-v1/`](generator-v1/): original version used in the paper.
- [`generator-v2/`](generator-v2/): alternative version that generates the video slightly differently.

Each subfolder has its own README and Python scripts.
